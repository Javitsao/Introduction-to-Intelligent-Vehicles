## CAN Protocol Timing Analysis (hw1):

This program analyzes the worst-case response time (Ri) of messages in a Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol according to the provided benchmark "input.dat".

**Requirements:**

- The benchmark file format is as follows:
    - The first line contains two numbers separated by a space:
        - `n`: Number of messages in the benchmark
        - `Ï„`: Arbitration time of a CAN message
    - Each subsequent line contains three numbers separated by spaces:
        - `Pi`: Priority of the message (higher number = higher priority)
        - `Ci`: Transmission time of the message (including data, overhead, and synchronization bits)
        - `Ti`: Period of the message (time between message transmissions)

**Functionality:**

1. **Worst-Case Response Time Calculation:**
    - The program calculates the worst-case response time (Ri) for each message.
    - This represents the maximum time a message can wait before being successfully transmitted.
2. **Output:**
    - The program prints `n` lines, where each line represents the worst-case response time (Ri) of a corresponding message in the benchmark order.

## Simulated Annealing for CAN Priority Assignment (hw2)

This program utilizes Simulated Annealing to optimize message priorities in a Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol, aiming to minimize the total worst-case response time.

**Requirements:**

- The benchmark file format is identical to the previous CAN Protocol Timing Analysis.

**Objective:**

- Minimize the sum of worst-case response times (Ri) for all messages in the CAN network.

**Constraints:**

- Message priority (Pi):
    - Integer value between 0 and n-1 (n being the total number of messages)
    - Unique for each message
- Worst-case response time (Ri) must be less than or equal to the message's period (Ti).
- Initial priorities are provided in the benchmark file.
- Runtime should be less than 15 seconds.

**Functionality:**

1. **Simulated Annealing Optimization:**
    - The program employs Simulated Annealing to iteratively adjust message priorities.
    - It strives to minimize the total worst-case response time for all messages.
2. **Output:**
    - The program prints `n` lines, where each line represents the optimized priority (Pi) of a corresponding message in the benchmark order.
    - It then prints a single line indicating the best objective value (lowest total worst-case response time) achieved during the optimization process.
